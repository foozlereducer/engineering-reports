Running The Tests

To run the tests you need to do the following:
1. Ensure that the app is started, at the 
   root of the project, in the terminal type - npm run start. This will allow
   the integration tests to run.
2. Test options:
    a. in a new terminal run - npm run test 
       ( this will run it is test watch mode) and will run all tests
    b. Or use - npm run debug ( this will run the tests once )
    c. to run a single test, in terminal type - ava --match='*foo*' 
       ( matches test titles containing foo) or move the wildcard around like:
       ava --match='foo*' ( names starting with foo)
3. Here are ava docs for more options: https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/main/docs/05-command-line.md
