It seems like the issue might be related to how the computed property isAuthenticated is being used in your components. Let's ensure that it's correctly defined and accessed:

Check Computed Property Definition:

Ensure that isAuthenticated is defined as a computed property using computed() in your components.
Verify that it's correctly computed from useAuthStore().isAuthenticated.
Computed Property Usage:

Double-check that isAuthenticated is correctly accessed in your template code, such as v-if="isAuthenticated".
Reactivity:

Since isAuthenticated is a computed property, it should automatically update when the underlying useAuthStore().isAuthenticated value changes.
Make sure that any changes to the isAuthenticated state in the store are correctly reflected in the computed property.
Here's an example of how you might define and use the computed property in your components:

vue
Copy code
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>Welcome to the Home Page</h1>
    <button @click="handleSignOut" v-if="isAuthenticated">Sign Out</button>
  </div>
  <router-link :to="{ name: 'Home' }" >Home</router-link> |
  <router-link :to="{ name: 'Login' }" v-if="!isAuthenticated">Login</router-link>
</template>

<script setup>
import { useAuthStore } from '../stores/authStore';
import { computed } from 'vue';

const authStore = useAuthStore();
const isAuthenticated = computed(() => authStore.isAuthenticated);

const handleSignOut = async () => {
  try {
    await authStore.signOut();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sign-out failed:', error.message);
    // Handle sign-out failure
  }
};
</script>
